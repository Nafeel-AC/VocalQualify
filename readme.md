# 🎙️ VocalQualify

**VocalQualify** is a full-stack, AI-powered lead qualification system that combines intelligent agent workflows, voice AI, and CRM automation to help businesses qualify leads more efficiently and follow up in a personalized, voice-first way.

## 🚀 Overview

Sales teams spend countless hours manually sorting through unqualified leads and sending repetitive emails. VocalQualify automates this process using:

- **LangGraph** for lead qualification logic.
- **n8n** for workflow automation and system orchestration.
- **Firebase** for real-time data storage and cloud functions.
- **VAPI** for natural-sounding voice call interactions.
- **CRM integration** (e.g., HubSpot or Zoho) for managing sales pipelines.

> With VocalQualify, your sales team can focus only on leads that matter — while the system does the talking, scoring, and syncing.

## 🧠 Core Features

### ✅ Smart Lead Intake
- Collect leads from web forms or marketing platforms via **n8n**.
- Push leads to **Firebase** and **CRM** in real-time.

### 🧠 Intelligent Lead Qualification (LangGraph)
- Use **LangGraph agents** to evaluate leads based on:
  - Budget
  - Timeline
  - Business need
  - Engagement tone
- Assign each lead a status: `Unqualified`, `Needs Follow-up`, or `Hot Lead`.

### 🎙️ Voice-Based Follow-Up (VAPI)
- For leads that need more info, the system automatically:
  - Initiates a **voice call using VAPI**
  - Gathers answers through a conversational agent
  - Transcribes and analyzes responses

### 🔄 Real-Time CRM Sync
- Update lead scores, statuses, and notes in CRM via **Firebase Functions** or **n8n workflows**.
- Automatically create CRM tasks for sales reps when a lead becomes “Hot.”

### 📬 Notifications & Scheduling
- Send Slack/email notifications to sales team for hot leads.
- Schedule follow-up calls or emails using n8n delay and scheduler nodes.

* Import workflows from `/n8n-workflows`
* Set credentials for:

  * Firebase
  * CRM
  * VAPI
  * LangGraph API

### 4. Deploy Firebase Functions

```bash
cd firebase-functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 5. Set up LangGraph Agent

## 🎯 Sample Lead Workflow

1. A user fills out a lead form on your website.
2. n8n receives the submission and stores it in Firebase.
3. Firebase triggers a LangGraph agent to evaluate the lead.
4. If "Needs follow-up", VAPI calls the lead.
5. VAPI returns transcript to Firebase.
6. Firebase triggers another workflow to:

   * Update CRM
   * Create a task for a sales rep
   * Notify via email/Slack

---

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

* ✨ AI-powered follow-up email generation after voice call
* 📈 Analytics dashboard for lead flow and conversion
* 🗃️ CRM-agnostic interface (switch between CRMs easily)
* 🔄 LangGraph memory to retain historical lead context
